### Remote upload and file management for Google Drive


This script automatically zips a folder with photos in it and uploads this zipped file to Google Drive. The script then deletes last month's automated backup since the file is about 3GB. The script is set to run monthly via a cron job.

See the official [PyDrive](https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/index.html) documentation for more info.
